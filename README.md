# DartCANReader
A short Dart program that shows how to read CAN frames. This repository provides a basic example for Dart developers who want to learn how to read Controller Area Network (CAN) frames using Dart.
This example uses the [linux_can](https://pub.dev/documentation/linux_can/latest/) Dart library to interact with Controller Area Network (CAN) frames.
